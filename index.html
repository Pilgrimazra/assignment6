        Steve Jobs was not just a man, an inventor, a teacher or a business man. steve created a whole new life to
        modern technology. He created a lifestyle. He may just be the prime example of the evolution of mankind. Enough
        was never enough. Steve Jobs IS a mastermind.

        Aside from the technological advances, Steve made good design cool. He gave it prestige and a monetary value. As
        a
        designer I am endebted to him and his design team at Apple for giving good design (from interfaces to logos to
        advertising) prestige. He made it art. Thank you Steve.

        <h1 class="header"> Thanks Steve </h1>
        Thanks Steve for being an inspiration to the world. Mere mortals with a clear vision truly can make a dent in
        the
        Universe.

        <h1 class="header"> Thanks... </h1>
        Just wanted to say thanks for making our household technology so much easier to use. A visionary with a grasp of
        what
        ordinary people want. You will be missed.

        Dear Apple Family, I never met Steve. And I was never in a room when he spoke. But every time I turn on my Apple
        computer and hear the classic gong, then see the classic bite from the Apple, I feel Steve's presence like a
        brother.
        Never, never again will the soul of man-made object be so fused with its creator. I grew up with Apple, and,
        therefore,
        grew up with Steve and his relentless pursuit to make me a computer that thought like me. I truly felt Steve
        worked for
        me, created for me, designed for me. His leadership of the company was simply that personal. To those of you
        fortunate
        to call Steve your friend, my deepest and most heartfelt sympathy. You are indeed blessed for having been so
        close to
        him.

        <h1 class="header"> R.I.P my dear Steve </h1>
        I can't believe this! I'm crying! Steve changed my life and everyone's.. I've no words to describe how I feel
        right
        now.. Please make heaven really sweet . All my love from an Argentinian fan

        <p class="author"> Nika from Argentina </p>

        <h1 class="header"> Thank you Steve - I will miss you </h1>
        My first computer that I would use was an Apple IIe. After that, I insisted, begged, my mom to buy a Apple IIc,
        and she
        did. I knew then that Apple would change our lives. Thank you Steve - I will miss you.

        <h1 class="header"> Remember the one that helped to shape the world. </h1>
        I have never met Mr. Jobs but I remember hearing his name while I was growing up. I remember when the first iPod
        was
        announced, the first iPhone, the first iPad and he was always there to usher the device into a new era. Apple is
        truly
        one of the most revolutionary companies the world has ever seen and there will probably never be another company
        that
        comes close to the magnificent family Steve Jobs molded it to be. I'm really going to miss Jobs, but what he has
        created
        will last way beyond any of our lifetimes and his name will surely resonate throughout time. My condolences to
        his
        friends and family, and thank you.

        I'd like to say that, just like happened with the whole world, you've changed my life. Not only with gadgets and
        devices, but with ideas and ways of thinking. You shall be remembered forever. As a genius. Rest in Peace.

        <h1 class="header"> Steve</h1>
        I never met Steve - and I sent him an email too late in his too-short life for him to reply. It's okay though,
        that he
        never got to reply to it. It's a fond reminder - maybe in a way more so than if he had written me back. Now I
        get to
        wonder what he would have said. I am a huge Apple fan of course, but even if I weren't I think everyone could
        say that
        he made our lives better - he spurred on competition and a rising tide floats all the boats. I am sure he is so,
        so
        missed. I miss him as a visionary and a force for the future, but he was a man, with family and friends. I hope
        they are
        well and take comfort that so many are thinking of them, as I am.

        We do not often see nor realize the accomplishments and brilliance of individuals prior to their demise. History
        normally reveals our past geniuses years after we've lost them and had time to ponder their gifts to our
        evolution.
        Steve Jobs was a rare exception to a class of innovators that have been able change how we live our lives. We
        should
        only be as fortunate as he. Steve, we thank you for your vision, realization, and most of all, your ability to
        move a
        planet.

        <h1 class="header"> Thank you Steve!!!</h1>
        Hello Apple team, Today is a sad day, Steve has been called by god and in his new place, he will continue with
        his great
        job, now next to the creator. God bless and receive to Steve, we will remember you every day!! Many thanks to
        all.

        <h1 class="header"> THANKS AND GOODBYE </h1>
        A day to say goodbye to a person who had both the strength and talent to make a lasting difference. Steve Jobs
        gave us gifts to live wonderful moments with the people we love. An inspiring man.

        Steve Changed the World One Idea At A Time
        Steve Changed the World One Idea At A Time. His ideas changed my life. Not because of insanely great products.
        But because he never lost sight of his dreams and taught us by example that we can choose to follow ours. Thank
        you Steve.
